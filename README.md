Abstract
--------

While deep learning has rapidly emerged as the dominant approach to training predictive models for large-scale machine learning problems, these algorithms push the limits of available hardware, requiring specialized frameworks optimized for GPUs and distributed cloud-based training. Moreover, especially in natural language processing (NLP), models contain a variety of moving parts: character-based encoders, pre-trained word embeddings, long-short term memory (LSTM) cells, and beam search for decoding sequential outputs, among others.

This tutorial introduces [GluonNLP](http://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp)), a powerful new toolkit that combines MXNet's speed, the user-friendly Gluon frontend, and an extensive new library automating the most painful aspects of deep learning for NLP. In this full-day tutorial, we will start off with a crash course on deep learning with Gluon, covering data, autodiff, and deep (convolutional and recurrent) neural networks. Then we'll dive into [GluonNLP](http://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/), demonstrating how to work with word embeddings (both pre-trained and from scratch), language models, and the popular Transformer model for machine translation.


Preparation
-----------
While most of the notebooks we prepared can run from the comfort of your laptop, some more interesting real-life problems benefit from more computation power. At the tutorial, we will provide each participant with a $50 AWS credit code for you to try out these problems yourself on the Amazon EC2 machines.

In preparation for the hands-on tutorial, **please make sure that you have an AWS account with at least one p2.8xlarge AND one p3.2xlarge instance in EU (Ireland) available for launch**. You may register an AWS account and **follow the instructions on [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) to verify and request for p2.8xlarge AND one p3.2xlarge instance limits** in **EU (Ireland)** region.
